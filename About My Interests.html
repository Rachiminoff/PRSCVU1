<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"> Gaming </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I typically play "Story Rich" games, which means the game isn't competitive like MLBB, Valorant, or CODM, where the excitement comes from playing with and against other people. I favor story-driven games since I enjoy reading. The most of the games I've played are RPGs (role playing games), but I'll play any genre as long as it's decent. I'm a fan of the Ace Attorney series and the Persona series (though I didn't play the first and second games since the controls were terrible), but Persona 4 Golden has one of the finest stories in JRPGs, and the qoute below this page's header is from Persona 3.Each Persona game incorporates a new concept into their narrative telling, which I think pretty poetic; to summarize the Persona 3 to 5 games;
<p style="text-align: left;"> Persona 3: Bring yourself closer to death, and only then will you see who you really are. Recognize the reality of mortality and protect the future within your time.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> Persona 4: Tear the tarot cards that dare foretell your fate. Face the darkest part of yourself and awaken a hidden power from within yourself. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> Persona 5: Strip away your mask to uncover your authentic self. Stand against injustice and embrace the life you desire. </p>

That said, I'm a fan of the Legend of Zelda series as well, and I've played almost all of the Zelda games save those on the Nintendo Switch, which I don't own. That being said, I played Genshin Impact because I enjoy Zelda games, and because Genshin was inspired by Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I figured I'd give it a go, and I'm now a fan of the game, and that led me into playing Honkai: Star Rail too, but I prefer Genshin over it. All that said, gaming honestly can be an expensive hobby. Video games are always evolving which means your PC or your phone has to keep up as well, not to mention the video games themselves aren't cheap.It all comes down to having the game titles you want to play and the necessary hardware specs to run them smoothly. Oh, and if you have the time to play it, some games can be incredibly long but most games are 7-9hrs long which can be finished within three days. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"> Literature</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> I like "Literature", it's mostly about manga, manhwa, manhua, or any form of Graphic Novel. I do read novels but quite rarely, I prefer seeing the scene being illustrated the way the author intended it to be portrayed than relying on my own imagination to interpret it. That said, I still don't mind reading novels as long as the story is good. I mostly read romance, psychological, mystery, and horror according to the stats presented by MyAnimeList on my account. Once I'm financially capable, I'd like to buy physical books instead of reading them on whatever website. Nothing beats the feeling of a real, actual book, and seeing your collection on the bookshelf. Anyway, If I really liked a story, I tend to overanalyze the contents that I think may have a deeper meaning, they tend to get really long that I a little editing and formatting can make them an essay. I often share them with my friend, or to anyone who's willing to indulge me. When it comes to studying or interpreting stories, I'm constantly on the lookout for someone who shares the same "passion" as myself. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"> Music</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> I listen to any kind of music. Any genre will do as long as I find the beat good, or the lyrics cleverly written. But according to my Spotify Wrapped from 2022 I mostly listened to Rock, Eurodance pop, and OPM. I do like rock songs, the other two were more of a coincidence. I also listen to classical music from time to time, since most pieces are 10 minutes long or longer, they aren't a for casual listen but I do enjoy them. I enjoy listening to music in any language. Any soundrack, score, or anything else.</p>

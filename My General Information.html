     <p style="text-align: left;"> My name is Tanya Denise Yambao. I was born on a Wednesday morning, August 18, 2004, at the Chinese General Hospital in Manila, but I spent the majority of my life in the Cavite province. My elementary education was at Del       Rosario Christian Institute, Imus branch. As a child, I mostly played video games and watched cartoons for enjoyment. Back then, I was inspired by video games and wanted to be a "game developer". It can be said that the child in me still influences me to       this day. When I was three years old, I was diagnosed with an illness. It was called Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, basically blood cancer. Naturally, I underwent chemotherapy for 7 years and graduated from cancer in 2011. This might sound a little       shocking,    but people needn't worry. I have been perfectly fine since then. Given that I wasn't a "normally perfect" child, I wasn't allowed to play outside along with the kids. I mostly played by myself, which is why I became fond of video games, I think. I       attended three different schools for high school: Dasmari√±as East Integrated High School, Luis Y. Ferrer Jr West National High School, and Tanza National Trade School. I studied STEM in TNTS for Senior High school. My time there was memorable and fun. I       consider it the peak of my high school life. As of the moment of writing, which is October 12, 2023, precisely at 5:40 PM, I am a first-year student enrolled in the BS Computer Science program at the main campus of Cavite State University. I am a member       of the BSCS 1 - 7 class, and my student identification number is 202304231.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Current Happenings, Happened</p></center>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> At home, my family and I have two dogs. Miszy, a female mini dachshund, and Mylo, a male beagle. They're sweet little gremlins, and the furbabies of my aunt and mom respectively, I happen to be the one who takes care of them       most of the time. They've only been with us for less than two years so they're still young, and full of energy. Here's a picture of them;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> My aunt and mother are quite close; they both enjoy dogs and kdrama. They frequently attend Korean actor fan meetings together; they have now attended three fan meetings. My mom got lucky twice, she ended up getting called  on stage with Lee Jae-wook and winning a chance to watch the rehearsal of Ok Taec-yeon. I was honestly surprised. Anyway, they invited me to go as well but I'm not really a fan of korean artists. We went to Bruno Mars' concert with all the three of us though! Once again, here's a picture of us.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> June 24, 2023 was the very first time I've set foot in the Philippine Arena, it was also the first time I attended a Bruno Mars concert. I wish we had a better camera with us back then to capture memories at a higher resolution., but all things well. I was also amazed by the structure of the Philippine Arena, and a little frightened, see those frills below the roof of the arena? Those actually where the seats are mounted on, people tend to jump during the concert and you will feel the ground bouncing faintly because of how the Arena is made. It was very impressive to see such engineering up close.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> I read that thise huge columns at the Philippine Arena, in addition to supporting the seating, are designed to be flexible. A clever safety measure, to be sure. In the case of an earthquake, these columns can wobble slightly, absorbing and distributing seismic stresses.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">That will be all about the Philippine Arena, I realized I talked more about it more than I did with Bruno Mars. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed his concert. I just didn't have the photos to show it.. Anyway, that will be the end for this topic. Moving on, after the concert came graduation and school break, and then start of classes in college. I have to say, my schedule was more jampacked in 12th grade than it is now, if only if it weren't for the commute, I'd say it's perfect. Anyway, that's all there is to it for this page. I'm concerned I'm writing more than necessary, but this what most blogs I've seen are.</p>

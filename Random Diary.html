<p class="justified"> I believe that giving recommendations is a more effective way of talking about my hobbies since I can talk more in each suggestion I write. Since I'm not with what to write for this page, I will treat it as a something similar to a diary, and the titles I will mention here can be considered as a recommendation.</p>

       <p style="text-align: left;"> Ace Attorney is a Visual Novel game, which means that the majority of the gameplay consists of reading, thinking, and deciding between alternatives. When compared to other game genres, it is quite a niche. In comparison to        other game genres, it is relatively a niche. Consider it a playable novel complete with graphics, animations, and music. Visual novels are usually considered linear in terms of gameplay because they are primarily story-driven games that emphasis storyline        and character development over gameplay. Part of the reason it isn't as popular as other genres is because most people don't want to read a lot of text when looking for a game to play. Which is completely understandable, but people should not miss out        on a classic like Ace Attorney.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">In Ace Attorney, you play as Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney. Defense attorneys protect those accused of crimes, campaigning for their rights, upholding the assumption of innocence, and offering a fair defense. The prosecution is the polar opposite of the defense; If defense attorneys are meant to believe in their client until the bitter end, the prosecutors' is meant to doubt on the case against the accused until the very end. In Ace Attorney, kindness and humanity are your strengths, not a weakness. As a defense lawyer building a bond of trust with your client is important, how could you hope to represent your client with such a weak conviction? But one cannot hope that every one of his clients is indeed innocent.  This is why I find it interesting how Ace Attorney emphasized that whether you are a defense lawyer or a prosecutor, your job is to fight for the truth and truth alone, that no amount of fabrication or lies cannot change a person's faith.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">That said, in terms of writing. Ace Attorney games generally have excellent humor,  I believe it's exceptionally well-executed, infusing a more cheerful atmosphere into what might otherwise be a dull and serious game. The humor in the makes the reading experience better. And while the game may seem episodic most cases are actually connected to an overarching story. The buildup towards the climax and conclusion which is usually the last case of every game is not rushed because of that.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> Lastly, in terms of gameplay, you do two main things: investigate and go to trial. When you investigate, you visit different places, talk to people, and find clues to solve a mystery. You also collect evidence, like a detective. In court, you become a lawyer, and your job is to prove your client is innocent. You question witnesses, show evidence, and say "Objection!" when find a contradiction It's like a big puzzle. If you make too many mistakes, you lose the case. You must use critical thinking skills to piece together the evidence and arguments presented in court to win your to that "Not Guilty" verdict.</p>
